# Google Maps Scraper

Mapsscraper is a simple and free open-source CLI tool for scraping business information from Google Maps.

Built in less than 500 lines of Go. The application scrapes business information from Google Maps using web automation. Given a set of coordinates, a query string and a search raduis, the tool collects details like business names, addresses, ratings, review counts, and phone numbers for a given search term and location and saves the results in a CSV file. A tipical search will find a couple of hundred results in a few minutes.
